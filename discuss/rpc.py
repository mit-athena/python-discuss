# 
# This file implements the protocol for discuss. discuss is the forum service
# from Project Athena which was intended as a clone of Multics forum
# application. discuss(1) still refers you to "Multics forum manual" (with a
# smileyface, which is probably due to the fact that the manpage itself hardly
# fills half of the normal terminal window size).
#
# By 2013, when this comment was written, that forum was used solely for
# storing mailing list archives. Hence this implementation at the current
# moment is sufficient only for extracting discussions, but not for posting.
#
# The protocol itself is based upon USP: "UNIX Universal Streaming Protocol",
# which was apparently one of the attempts to create a universal data
# representation protocol (like XDR, ASN.1, XML, JSON, protobufs, etc) used by
# the discuss developers because that was a new shiny thing from LCS back in
# the day. One would guess that since the only implementation of it still in
# the wild is discuss, the protocol is only used by discuss itself. This is,
# not, however, true. Discuss does not actually use USP: it hijacks into the
# middle of USP library, copies the parts of the connection code and then uses
# the USP data representation routines (which are not even exported from that
# library in heaeder files) without actually doing USP.
#
# As I found out (because of the copyright header), the protocol was part of
# certain distriubted mail system called PCmail, which even has a few RFCs
# dedicated to it.
#
# The USP code is in usp/ tree and the discuss usage of it is in
# libds/rpcall.c. Note that in Debathena those are compiled as two different
# static libraries. libds uses usp routines, even though they are not even
# exported in the header file. On, and the whole suite is written in K&R C.
